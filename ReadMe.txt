A multi-tenanted, Role-Based access control authentication API with Node.js, TypeScript, fastify, Drizzle ORM, PosgresSQL from Neon. 

In a multi-tenanted Role Based Access Control (RBAC) system, each user belongs to a specific tenant and is assigned roles that determine their permissions within that tenant. This ensures that even though multiple tenants share the same platform, their data and user operations are isolated and secure. The use of roles simplifies managing permissions by grouping related permissions and assigning them to users as needed.
